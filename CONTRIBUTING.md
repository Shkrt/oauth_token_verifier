### Reporting issues

Please, provide further explanations to your issue:

- Expected behaviour

- Actual behaviour

- Steps to reproduce

Make sure to include as much information as possible. It's even better if you include test, showin failing scenario,
or all-in-one script to make easier to reproduce the bug.

### Submitting a pull request

Key points when submitting a pull request:

- Add tests

- Update documentation

- Make all changes in feature branch, i.e. `feature/tg_integration`

- Make one pull request for each feature, don't include all in one pull request

- Maintain sensible commit history
